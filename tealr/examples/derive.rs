//this example shows how the new traits allow you to generate the .d.tl file
//and shows how to use them to share data with lua
//It also shows how to generate the file
//NOTE: All it does it generate the contents of the file. Storing it is left to the user.

//First, create the struct you want to export to lua.
//instead of both deriving UserData and TypeRepresentation you can also
//derive TealDerive, which does both. However you will still need to import
//UserData and TypeRepresentation
//The clone is only needed because one of the example functions has it as a parameter
#[derive(Clone, UserData, TypeRepresentation)]
struct Example {}

//now, implement TealData. This tells rlua what methods are available and tealr what the types are
